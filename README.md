## What is this?
* Front End part of my personal HawkTrack project that I built.
* Here's the link to the Back End:
* https://github.com/luangf/HawkTrack-Back
* It's a project where users can log in, create categories, and add any type of items inside them, for example, a "Bills" category where they can upload photos, files, and text notes. (Under development)
